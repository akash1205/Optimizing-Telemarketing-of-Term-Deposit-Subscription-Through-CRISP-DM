Details about the files

The main project report is in the file 'IS7036-001-Group01_ProjectReport'.

Some images which were not included in the report itself, have been included in the file 'IS7036-001-Group01_Appendix', and referenced through the main project file.

The streams for the 4 models built have been included in the 4 stream files, named as 'IS7036-001-Group01_ProjectReport_XXXXX.str'(XXXXX - Algorithm).

The source file for the dataset is 'bank-full - Copy.csv' . This is the final cleaned data file that we are using as the source for the project.

After the first stratified sampling is performed, we have taken the ouptut of that sampling into two different files, namely

'Training.csv'
'Testing.csv'

The main reason for doing this was we wanted to keep the samme stratified sample dataset for all the different models.

If the stratified sampling is run on the individual model, even with the same parameters, the eventual outputs for that will vary, since the entire stream is run at the time of execution.

A generic comparison to identify the best model which fits the data is shown in the file 'IS7036-001-Group01_Performance_Eval.str'.
